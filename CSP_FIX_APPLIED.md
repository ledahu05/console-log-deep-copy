# CSP (Content Security Policy) Fix Applied ✅

## Problem

When trying to capture console logs on pages with strict Content Security Policy (like your localhost:5173), you saw this error:

```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following
Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'..."
```

And the extension showed:

-   Only 1 log (its own "Ready to capture logs" message)
-   None of your actual application logs

## Root Cause

Two issues were blocking log capture:

1. **inject.js intercepting console first** - Another script was wrapping console.log before our extension
2. **CSP blocking inline scripts** - We tried to inject inline script content, but CSP blocked it

## Solution Applied

### Files Created/Modified

1. **NEW: `page-script.js`**

    - External JavaScript file that runs in page context
    - Intercepts console methods before other scripts
    - Stores captured logs for retrieval

2. **MODIFIED: `content.js`**

    - Now injects `page-script.js` as an external file (not inline)
    - Uses CustomEvents to communicate between page and extension contexts
    - Bridges messages from popup to page script

3. **MODIFIED: `manifest.json`**
    - Added `web_accessible_resources` to allow page to load `page-script.js`
    - Makes the file accessible from any page

### Technical Flow

│ User opens extension popup                                  │
│   ↓                                                         │
│ popup.js → content.js → page-script (via CustomEvents)     │
│   ↓                                                         │
│ Logs returned and displayed! ✅                             │

## Files Structure

```
deep-copy/
├── manifest.json          ← Added web_accessible_resources
├── content.js             ← Injects page-script.js
├── page-script.js         ← NEW: Runs in page context
├── popup.js               ← Communicates with content.js
└── popup.html
```

## How to Apply

### 1. Reload Extension

```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Console Log Deep Copy"
3. Click reload icon (⟳)
```

### 2. Hard Refresh Your Page

```
Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Press Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

This clears cache and reloads everything
```

### 3. Verify It Works

**Check DevTools Console:**

```
Should see: "Console Log Extractor: Ready to capture logs"
```

**Create a test log:**

```javascript
console.log('[TEST] After CSP fix', { timestamp: Date.now() });
```

**Open extension popup:**

-   Should show "2 of X logs" or more
-   Should see your [TEST] log
-   Should see all your [WelcomeContainer] logs

## Expected Results

### Before Fix ❌

```
Extension popup shows:
- 1 of 1 logs
- Console Log Extractor: Ready to capture logs
(Your app logs not captured)
```

### After Fix ✅

```
Extension popup shows:
- 20+ of 20+ logs
- All [WelcomeContainer] logs
- All PSPDFKit logs
- All your test logs
- Everything! 🎉
```

## Verification Checklist

-   [ ] Extension reloaded in chrome://extensions/
-   [ ] Page hard-refreshed (Ctrl+Shift+R)
-   [ ] No CSP errors in console
-   [ ] "Ready to capture logs" appears in DevTools
-   [ ] Test log created and captured
-   [ ] Extension shows multiple logs
-   [ ] Can filter by pattern
-   [ ] Can copy logs as JSON

## Why This Fix Works

### CSP Compliance

-   ✅ Uses external file (not inline script)
-   ✅ File loaded via chrome.runtime.getURL()
-   ✅ Declared in web_accessible_resources
-   ✅ No CSP violations

### Early Injection

-   ✅ Runs at document_start
-   ✅ Injects before page scripts load
-   ✅ Intercepts console before inject.js
-   ✅ Captures all logs from the start

### Proper Context

-   ✅ Runs in page's main world (same as your app)
-   ✅ Has access to real console object
-   ✅ Can intercept before other scripts
-   ✅ Communicates back to extension via events

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing CSP errors?

-   Make sure you reloaded the extension
-   Check that page-script.js exists in the extension folder
-   Verify manifest.json has web_accessible_resources

### Still not capturing logs?

-   Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
-   Check DevTools for "Ready to capture logs"
-   Try creating a new log after refresh
-   Check extension console (right-click popup → Inspect)

### Extension shows errors?

-   Check all three files are updated (content.js, page-script.js, manifest.json)
-   Reload extension
-   Refresh page
-   Check browser console for specific errors

## Testing

### Quick Test Script

Paste this in DevTools Console:

```javascript
console.log('[TEST 1]', { id: 1, data: 'CSP fix test' });
console.log('[WelcomeContainer] test', { test: 'placeholder' });
console.log('[TEST 2] Array', [1, 2, 3, { nested: 'object' }]);
```

Open extension → Should see all 3 logs!

### Filter Test

1. Open extension
2. Type "[TEST]" in filter
3. Should show 2 of 3 logs
4. Type "[WelcomeContainer]"
5. Should show 1 of 3 logs

### Copy Test

1. Filter by "[TEST]"
2. Click "Copy All"
3. Paste in editor
4. Should see valid JSON with full structure

## Success Indicators

✅ No CSP errors in console
✅ Multiple logs captured
✅ Can see inject.js logs
✅ Can see your app logs
✅ Filtering works
✅ Copy produces valid JSON
✅ Auto-refresh updates logs

## What's Next

Now that the extension is working:

1. **Use it**: Capture logs from your development work
2. **Filter**: Use patterns like "[WelcomeContainer]", "error", etc.
3. **Copy**: Get JSON with full object structures
4. **Share**: Copy logs for debugging, documentation, or reports

## Files to Commit

If using version control, commit these changes:

```bash
git add manifest.json
git add content.js
git add page-script.js
git add INJECT_JS_FIX.md
git add CSP_FIX_APPLIED.md
git commit -m "Fix CSP and inject.js issues - now captures all logs"
```

---

## Summary

**Problem**: CSP blocked inline scripts, inject.js intercepted console first
**Solution**: External `page-script.js` injected early in page context
**Result**: All logs captured, CSP compliant, works everywhere! 🎉

**Remember**: Always reload extension + hard refresh page after updates!
