# Fix for inject.js and Other Console Interceptors

## Problem

If you see logs in DevTools showing `inject.js:94` or similar, it means another script is intercepting `console.log` before our extension. This prevents our extension from capturing the logs.

### Example

```
inject.js:94 [WelcomeContainer] question {test: 'placeholder'}
inject.js:94 [TEST] Array (4) [1, 2, 3, {…}]
```

## Solution Applied

The extension now injects itself into the page's main context **immediately** before any other scripts can run. This allows it to intercept console calls before `inject.js` or any other interceptor.

### How It Works

1. **Content script loads** at `document_start`
2. **Immediately injects** a `<script>` tag into the page
3. **Script runs in page context** (same world as inject.js)
4. **Intercepts console** before anything else
5. **Captures all logs** including those from inject.js

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### 1. Reload the Extension

```bash
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Console Log Deep Copy"
3. Click the reload icon (⟳)
```

### 2. Refresh Your Page

```bash
Press F5 or Ctrl+R to refresh localhost:5173
```

### 3. Test It

```javascript
// In DevTools Console, run:
console.log('[TEST] Hello', { data: 123 });
```

### 4. Open Extension

You should now see the log captured!

## Verification

After reloading extension and refreshing page:

✅ **Extension popup should show:**

-   Your test logs
-   All `inject.js` logs
-   Stats showing "X of X logs"

❌ **If still showing only extension's own log:**

-   Make sure you **reloaded the extension** in chrome://extensions/
-   Make sure you **refreshed the page** (F5)
-   Check DevTools console for any errors

## Why This Happens

Some pages or extensions inject scripts that wrap `console.log`:

-   **inject.js** - Common in development tools
-   **React DevTools** - Wraps console in development
-   **Other extensions** - May intercept console
-   **Build tools** - Vite, Webpack may inject logging

Our extension now runs **before** all of these by injecting directly into the page context at `document_start`.

## Technical Details

### Old Approach (Didn't Work)

```javascript
// Content script tries to intercept console
console.log = function (...args) {
    /* capture */
};
// ❌ But runs too late, inject.js already wrapped it
```

### New Approach (Works)

```javascript
// Inject script file into page IMMEDIATELY
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('page-script.js');
document.head.insertBefore(script, document.head.firstChild);
// ✅ Runs before inject.js loads
// ✅ External file avoids CSP inline script restrictions
```

### CSP Compatibility

The extension uses an external file (`page-script.js`) instead of inline scripts to comply with Content Security Policy restrictions that many sites have. This makes it work on more pages.

### Communication Bridge

Since the interceptor runs in the page's main world and the extension popup needs data from the isolated content script world, we use CustomEvents:

```
Page World              Content Script World       Extension
┌─────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐       ┌────────┐
│ Intercept   │  event │ Bridge Script    │  msg  │ Popup  │
│ console.log ├────────>│ (content.js)     ├───────>│        │
│ Store logs  │<───────┤ Request/Response │<──────┤        │
└─────────────┘        └──────────────────┘       └────────┘
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Check Interception

```javascript
// Run in DevTools Console AFTER reloading extension and page
console.log('[TEST]', { timestamp: Date.now() });
```

Open extension → Should see `[TEST]` log

### Test 2: Check inject.js Logs

```javascript
// Your existing logs that show inject.js:94
// Should now be captured by extension
```

Open extension → Should see those logs

### Test 3: Run Full Test Script

```javascript
// Copy contents of test-in-console.js
// Paste into DevTools
// Open extension
```

Should see 6+ logs

## Troubleshooting

### Still not working?

1. **Clear browser cache**

    ```
    Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images and files
    ```

2. **Hard reload page**

    ```
    Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
    Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
    ```

3. **Check extension loaded**

    ```
    DevTools Console should show:
    "Console Log Extractor: Ready to capture logs"
    ```

4. **Verify script injection**
    ```javascript
    // In DevTools Console:
    console.log.toString();
    // Should show our wrapper function
    ```

### If extension's own log appears multiple times

This is normal! It means:

-   Once from the page context (injected script)
-   Extension is working correctly

Just filter it out if needed.

## Success!

After applying this fix, your extension should now capture **all** console logs, even when inject.js or other interceptors are present.

The key is that our extension now runs in the same world as the page's code, intercepting console calls before any other script can.

**Remember:** After updating the extension code, always:

1. Reload extension in chrome://extensions/
2. Refresh your page (F5)
3. Test with a new console.log

Enjoy capturing all your logs! 🎉
